\maketitle

\textbf{(1)} Let \(H, K \leq G\) be two subgroups of a given group \(G\). Show that for \(a \in G\) the coset \(a(H \cap K)\) is equal to \((aH)\cap (aK)\), i.e. is equal to the intersection of the cosets \(aH\) and \(aK\). \\



\textbf{(2)} Use the Theorem of Lagrange (and its consequences) to show that \(|(\mathbb{Z}/n)^{\times}|\) is always even when \(n > 2\). \\



\textbf{(3)} Suppose \(G\) is a finite abelian group and \(|G|\) is odd. Show that the product of all the elements in \(G\) is the identity. Is the same true if \(|G|\) is even? \\



\textbf{(4)} Let \(|G| = 8\). Prove that \(G\) has an element of order \(2\). \\



\textbf{(5)} Let \(G\) be a group and let \(H, K \leq G\) be subgroups satisfying \(|H| = 20\) and \(|K| = 28\). Prove tha \(H \cap K\) is abelian. (Hint: Start by computing the order of \(H \cap K\). We've seen that \(H \cap K\) is a subgroup of \(G\), but it can also be viewed as a subgroup of...). \\
